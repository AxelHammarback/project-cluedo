# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

The assignment was to create a simple Cluedo "mystery reveal" application. You, the game master, picks three cards – suspect, murder weapon, and the room where it happened – and reveal it to the rest of the players.


## The problem

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 

As this week was all about Javascript, there's a lot of function calls and some randomisations going on to display the different objects on the DOM. Since all of this is new territory, my goal was to really understand the Javascript parts, which is why I settled for the blue level.
